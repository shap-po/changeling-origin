# Changeling Origin

<a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/changeling-origin"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Modrinth-Download-blue?logo=modrinth"></a>

This mod adds Changeling Origin - an odd creature that can change its form into creatures it kills.

"_Changelings are shapeshifters that can take on the form of other creatures. As their descendant, you have inherited
this ability, but activating it requires a blood sacrifice._"

### Abilities

- **Shapeshift** (toggle) - Allows you to shapeshift into the next creature you kill. If you are already shapeshifted, you will revert to your original form.
- **Use Shape Ability** (active) - Activates special ability of your current shape. You can check the list of shape abilities [on the woodwalkers wiki](https://github.com/ToCraft/woodwalkers-mod/wiki/Abilities).
- **Lose Shape on Death** - You will revert to your original form if you die.

### Configuration

If you want to prevent players from shaping into some creatures, you can add them into `tags/entity_types/denylist`.
Creatures that are not allowed by default: `Wither`, `Ender Dragon`, and `Vex`.

## Requirements

- [Origins](https://modrinth.com/mod/origins)
- [woodwalkers](https://modrinth.com/mod/woodwalkers)
- [Shappoli](https://modrinth.com/mod/shappoli)

## Warning

If you are already using [woodwalkers](https://modrinth.com/mod/woodwalkers), adding this mod is not recommended as it will make the shape-shifting mechanic available only to
**Changelings**.
